Release notes for ROOTGanilTape Development Release 0.0.4
--------------------------------------------------------

What is ROOTGanilTape ?
-----------------------

ROOTGanilTape is a ROOT/C++ wrapper around ganil_tape libs (see 
ftp://ftp.ganil.fr/pub/acq/) that helps to read and analyse data on
tapes and files at GANIL format using the ROOT toolkit.
Usage should be very end-user oriented, keeped efficient and simple.


Where can one found it ?
-------------------

There are a few chances you'll find it here:
http://ganp188.in2p3.fr/garp/soft/ROOTGanilTape/
But I wouldnt bet on it.
If you cant find it, drop me a mail: patois@ganil.fr


License
-------

This software is released under the GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE version 2
or above. See file LICENSE for details.


Software Requirements
---------------------

- For now it has only been tested on i386-Linux/g++ (and partially on
  Alpha/g++ and SunOS/CC5.0), may works without too much changes on 
  any UNIX flavor where ROOT is supported.

- ganil_tape (ftp://ftp.ganil.fr/pub/acq/) installed.
  See GANILTAPE variable in Makefile and set it appropriatly

- ROOT (http://root.cern.ch) installed ($ROOTSYS must be defined).

- GNUmake or a GNU compatible 'make'. Some proprietary make command
  doesnt recognise the ':=' operator.

- makedepend, for dependancies checks (it is found in XFree
  dev. packages). If you dont have it, comment the line 'include
  dependancies.make' in Makefile and go without it.

- a C++ compiler (The one used to compile ROOT).


Documentation to read
---------------------

Documentation is at http://ganp188.in2p3.fr/garp/soft/ROOTGanilTape/
API autodocumentation can be created by typing:
$ make html

HTML doc will then reside in ./html or ./htmldoc (a ROOT bug ?).


Building ROOTGanilTape
----------------------

- Check that the env variable $HOSTTYPE is defined and is either
  linux-i586 or alpha. Otherwise, you must create a
  config/Makefile.$HOSTTYPE file. Inspire yourself from the existing
  one. I suggest you to just do a copy of Makefile.linux-i586 to
  Makefile.$HOSTTYPE, in many cases this should be enough.

- Have a look in the Makefile, check in particular that GANILTAPE path 
  is correct. Also looks at the INSTALL path.

- Then do:
  $ make

- You'll need to install the libs at proper location for the programm
  to work:
  $ make install

- Then you can create the autodocumentation:
  $ make html


Usage
-----

See the Example program, and adapt it to your needs.


KNOWN BUGS
----------

- A bug in ganil_tape (under linux i386) prevent the EOF to be
  acknowledged  when reading a tape (on file it's OK). This bug could
  be a bug in libc, but I dont know for sure. I may implement an hugly
  workaround, or better, smash the bug.

- This is a very preliminary release. There are too much potential
  bugs, unexpected behaviors and limitations that I could event list
  them all.


Planned evolution
-----------------

- Correcting bugs.
- Maybe automatic histogramm filling from data.
- Maybe FORTRAN/CERNLIB interface.
- Better cross-plateform behavior.
- Better Makefile
- A 'ganiltape'-like tool (handling tape copy)
