<br>
<h2>INDRA data reduction</h2>
<br>
Many improvements mainly concerning the reduction of data from the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">5th
campaign of experiments</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>corrected thicknesses of 112/124Sn targets. The nominal thickness
(330 &micro;g/cm2) has been replaced with the measured value of
530&micro;g/cm2.</li>
  <li>identification &amp; calibration for the forward rings (1-9)
takes into account as much as possible the coherency between CsI,
Si-CsI and ChIo-Si identifications. Energy losses of identified
particles are calculated in detectors in which pile-up appears to have
occured, but no attempt is made to identify the apparent second
particle (no IDCode 6).<br>
  </li>
  <li>CsI energy losses of all particles are checked, if they are
greater than the maximum theoretical energy loss the particle is given
energy code (ECode) 3.</li>
  <li>the real thicknesses of all (nominal) 300&micro;m Silicon
detectors are used. The thicknesses of Si75 and Si(Li) detectors
(including dead zones) are included.</li>
  <li>all particles whose mass is not measured have A calculated from Z
using Charity EAL formula (KVNucleus::kEALMass formula).</li>
  <li>discrimination of neutrons is performed for all forward rings
(1-9) by comparison of CsI and Si-CsI identifications.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Reorganisation of analysis tasks</h2>
<br>
The "raw-&gt;ident" analysis task has been suppressed; it is obsolete
as now "recon" data is independent of any changes made to detector
geometry, calibrations, etc. "recon" data should be generated from raw
data once and for all, and all subsequent processing done by
"recon-&gt;ident" task.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Filtering simulated events</h2>
<br>
New "simulation mode" for detectors (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVDetector.html#KVDetector:SetSimMode">KVDetector::SetSimMode</a>)
and multidetector arrays (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVMultiDetArray.html#KVMultiDetArray:SetSimMode">KVMultiDetArray::SetSimMode</a>
- this just turns on the "simulation mode" for all detectors of the
array). In "simulation mode" a detector is "fired" (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVDetector.html#KVDetector:Fired">KVDetector::Fired</a>
returns kTRUE) if the calculated energy loss in its active layer is
non-zero.<br>
New method <a
 href="1.8.1/KVMultiDetArray.html#KVMultiDetArray:DetectEvent">KVMultiDetArray::DetectEvent
</a>takes as input a <a href="1.8.1/KVEvent.html">KVEvent</a> (or
child class) and produces a <a href="1.8.1/KVReconstructedEvent.html">KVReconstructedEvent</a>
with the reconstructed detected nuclei. If the simulated event contains
<a href="1.8.1/KVSimNucleus.html">KVSimNucleus</a> objects, information
on the detection of each will be added to their parameter list.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Reorganisation of class hierarchies</h2>
<br>
In order to facilitate use of KaliVeda outside of a purely INDRA
context, new classes have been introduced to separate INDRA-specific
behaviour of detectors (KVINDRADetector), telescopes
(KVINDRATelescope), and identification telescopes (KVINDRAIDTelescope).
All INDRA detectors, telescopes, and identification telescopes now
inherit from these classes, instead of directly from the base classes
KVDetector, KVTelescope, and KVIDTelescope. The main difference
concerns automatic generation of names for the different objects.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Nuclear Data Tables</h2>
<br>
Many experimental informations on nuclei have been added/updated - mass
excess (<a href="1.8.1/KVMassExcess.html">KVMassExcess</a>), lifetimes (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVLifeTime.html">KVLifeTime</a>), and abundances (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVAbundance.html">KVAbundance</a>) are handled by new
Nuclear Data Table manager class <a href="1.8.1/KVNDTManager.html">KVNDTManager</a>
accessible through a gNDTManager global pointer set up by
KVBase::InitEnvironnement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Interface to ROOT geometry package and VMC</h2>
<br>
Several improvements have been made to the ROOT geometry generated from
a KVMultiDetArray (method <a
 href="1.8.1/KVMultiDetArray.html#KVMultiDetArray:CreateGeoManager">KVMultiDetArray::CreateGeoManager</a>),
with a view to using it with the Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) package
provided by ROOT in order to interface with packages such as GEANT3 and
GEANT4.<br>
All TGeoMaterials used in the geometry for composite materials in the
KVedaLoss package (such as C3F8, Mylar, CsI, etc.) now have the correct
chemical composition required for VMC simulations. In addition, purely
for esthetic reasons, the materials appear in the GL viewer as
transparent, allowing to see more easily the internal structure of the
geometry.<br>
<img style="width: 803px; height: 499px;" alt="New TGeo INDRA"
 title="New TGeo INDRA" src="images/newIndraTGeo.png"><br>
The logical structure of the generated TGeoVolumes now follows the
layer-ring-telescope structure of KVMultiDetArray, which makes it easy
to visualize individual rings or telescopes using the standard ROOT
browser:<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Stopping Power &amp; Range Tables for Heavy Ions</h2>
<br>
In previous versions, the class used to describe materials making up
detectors and targets, <a href="1.8.1/KVMaterial.html">KVMaterial</a>,
was itself an implementation of the VEDALOSS range tables used by the
INDRA collaboration. This serious design flaw has now been corrected.
The role of KVMaterial is just to describe properties of absorbers
which make up detectors and targets. The calculation of energy losses,
range, etc. of heavy ions in these absorbers is handled through an
abstract interface, <a href="1.8.1/KVIonRangeTable.html">KVIonRangeTable</a>.
The
specific
implementation
to be used is determined by an environment
variable:<br>
<pre>KVMaterial.IonRangeTable:     VEDALOSS</pre>
and all implementations are plugin classes derived from KVIonRangeTable:<br>
<pre>Plugin.KVIonRangeTable:   VEDALOSS   KVedaLoss   KVMultiDet   <span
 class="string">"KVedaLoss()"</span></pre>
By default, the range table used is a new implementation of the
VEDALOSS package, <a href="1.8.1/KVedaLoss.html">KVedaLoss</a> (see <a
 href="#KVedaLoss">below</a>).<br>
<br>
<h3>IMPORTANT - Units!</h3>
In previous versions of KVMaterial, different materials had different
"default" units to describe their "thickness", which also had a
different meaning depending on the material (linear dimension for some,
area density for others, or even pressure for gases). For this new
implementation, we have standardised the units for dimension, mass, and
pressure, and a new namespace <a href="1.8.1/KVUnits.html">KVUnits</a>
can be used to facilitate conversions. In addition, the <a
 href="1.8.1/KVMaterial.html">KVMaterial</a> interface has been
clarified to distinguish between linear dimensions and area density
(see <a href="#KVMaterial">below</a>). Unless otherwise stated, all
linear dimensions are in centimetres, all masses are in grammes, and
all pressures are in torr. Units and "thickness" have the same meaning
for all materials. See <a href="1.8.1/KVUnits.html">KVUnits</a> for
converting from one unit to another.<br>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>Units for INDRA detectors</h4>
For backwards compatibility, we have kept the "special units" for
specific implementations of INDRA detectors. Thus, thicknesses of INDRA
silicon detectors (<a href="1.8.1/KVSilicon.html">KVSilicon</a>) are
still in microns, gas pressures of ionisation chambers (<a
 href="1.8.1/KVChIo.html">KVChIo</a>) are still in millibar, and the
lengths of Cesium Iodide scintillators (<a href="1.8.1/KVCsI.html">KVCsI</a>)
are
still
in
centimetres. Note that these classes now inherit the new <a
 href="1.8.1/KVINDRADetector.html">KVINDRADetector</a> base class.<br>
<br>
<h3>Changes to existing classes</h3>
<h4><a name="KVMaterial"></a>KVMaterial</h4>
There are now three constructors for defining absorbers, by linear
thickness, by area density, or the special case of a gas (for which
temperature and pressure must be specified):<br>
<pre>KVMaterial(const Char_t * type, const Double_t thick = 0.0);<br>KVMaterial(Double_t area_density, const Char_t * type);<br>KVMaterial(const Char_t * gas, const Double_t thick, const Double_t pressure, const Double_t temperature = 19.0);<br></pre>
The methods <span style="font-family: monospace;">Get/SetThickness</span>
now have the same meaning for all materials: they concern the linear
dimensions of the absorber (standard units: centimetres). New methods <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Get/SetAreaDensity</span> apply in the
same way to all, with standard units of g/cm**3.<br>
The methods<br>
<pre>Double_t GetBraggDE(Int_t Z, Int_t A)<br>Double_t GetBraggE(Int_t Z, Int_t A)<br></pre>
have been renamed:<br>
<pre>Double_t GetMaxDeltaE(Int_t Z, Int_t A)<br>Double_t GetEIncOfMaxDeltaE(Int_t Z, Int_t A)<br></pre>
and, as their names now imply, they return the maximum possible energy
loss and the incident energy for which this maximum occurs,
respectively, for a given ion.<br>
<br>
The methods <span style="font-family: monospace;">GetEmin/maxVedaloss(UInt_t
Z)</span> obviously no longer exist; instead, there is a generic method
for obtaining the upper limit to the current range table's validity,<br>
<pre>Double_t GetEmaxValid(Int_t Z, Int_t A)<br></pre>
The "solution type" enumeration used in the previous implementation of
the methods<br>
<pre>Double_t GetIncidentEnergy(Int_t Z, Int_t A, Double_t dE=-1.0, KVMaterial::SolType type=kEmax)<br>Double_t GetEResFromDeltaE(Int_t Z, Int_t A, Double_t dE=-1.0, KVMaterial::SolType type=kEmax)<br></pre>
is no longer part of KVMaterial, it has been moved to the abstract base
class for range tables, KVIonRangeTable. The two possible values of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">KVIonRangeTable::SolType</span> are <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">KVIonRangeTable::kEmax</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">KVIonRangeTable::kEmin</span>.<br>
<br>
The method <span style="font-family: monospace;">KVIonRangeTable*
KVMaterial::GetRangeTable()</span> returns the address of the current
default range table implementation.<br>
<br>
<h4>KVDetector</h4>
Following the normalisation of units and conventions in KVMaterial, the
constructor<br>
<pre>KVDetector(const Char_t* type, const Float_t thick=0.0)<br></pre>
creates an absorber with linear thickness given in centimetres,
whatever the nature of the chosen material.<br>
A new general method for calculating the total energy loss of an ion in
the detector based on the measured energy loss in the 'active' layer
has been introduced:<br>
<pre>Double_t GetCorrectedEnergy(Int_t Z, Int_t A, Double_t de=-1., Bool_t transmission=kTRUE)<br></pre>
(in previous versions, this method just returned the measured energy
loss, specific corrections were implemented in child classes). The
energy loss <span style="font-family: monospace;">de</span> does not
allow an unambiguous answer for particles which punch through, as in
general it is not always correct to assume that such particles have an
incident energy beyond the maximum of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">dE(E) </span>curve. If the residual
energy of the particle is also measured, the ambiguity disappears. It
should first be set by calling new method<br>
<pre>void SetEResAfterDetector(Double_t eres)<br></pre>
This allows to obtain correct energies for all punch-through particles.<br>
In addition, if the measured dE is &gt; max theoretical dE for given
(Z,A), we increase the Z of the given nucleus (using the nucleus' mass
formula to calculate A) until the dE is &lt; max theoretical. Then we
perform the correction for the new Z (the Z and A of the nucleus given
as argument remain unchanged).<br>
<br>
The new method<br>
<pre>void ReadDefinitionFromFile(const Char_t* envrc)<br></pre>
can be used to define new detectors using only '.rootrc'-style text
files, for example:<br>
<pre># MyDet.rc<br># Example file to use with KVDetector::ReadDefinitionFromFile<br>Layer:  Gold<br>Gold.Material:   Au<br>Gold.AreaDensity:   200.*KVUnits::ug<br>+Layer:  Gas1<br>Gas1.Material:   C3F8<br>Gas1.Thickness:   5.*KVUnits::cm<br>Gas1.Pressure:   50.*KVUnits::mbar<br>Gas1.Active:    yes<br>+Layer:  Si1<br>Si1.Material:   Si<br></pre>
<pre>Si1.Thickness:   300.*KVUnits::um<br></pre>
To create the new detector, it is only necessary to do:<br>
<pre>KVDetector* D = new KVDetector;<br>D-&gt;ReadDefinitionFromFile("MyDet.rc");<br></pre>
New methods are provided for calculating the range of particles in
detectors, and also the punch-through energy for any given ion. <a
 href="1.8.1/KVDetector.html#KVDetector:DrawPunchThroughEnergyVsZ">KVDetector::DrawPunchThroughEnergyvsZ</a>
creates a TGraph which gives the punch-through energy as a function of
Z for Z=1 to Z=92. <a
 href="1.8.1/KVMultiDetArray.html#KVMultiDetArray:DrawPunchThroughEnergyVsZ">KVMultiDetArray::DrawPunchThroughEnergyvsZ(const
Char_t* detector)</a> does the same but takes into account any
detectors which are placed in front of the detector in question in the
array geometry; the punch-through energy in this case corresponds to
the incident energy required to punch through all previous detectors
plus the detector in question.<br>
<br>
<h4>KVTarget</h4>
In accordance with convention, all target "thicknesses" are expressed
in terms of area density, with standard units mg/cm**2.<br>
<h4><br>
</h4>
<h4>KVChIo</h4>
The previous specific GetCorrectedEnergy method has been replaced by
the new generic method in KVDetector. The mylar correction for
low-energy punching-through heavy ions (around the Bragg curve) is
better treated by using the residual energy measured behind the ChIo.<br>
<br>
<h4>KVSilicon, KVPulseHeightDefect</h4>
The previous specific GetCorrectedEnergy method has been replaced by
the new generic method in KVDetector. As before, the energy loss
function for silicon detectors is replaced by a function including (if
defined) the pulse height defect (PHD). The correction for low-energy
punching-through heavy ions is better treated by using the residual
energy measured behind the silicon detector.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="KVedaLoss"></a>KVedaLoss</h3>
<a href="1.8.1/KVedaLoss.html">KVedaLoss</a> and <a
 href="1.8.1/KVedaLossMaterial.html">KVedaLossMaterial</a> are new
implementations of the VEDALOSS range &amp; energy loss tables
previously implemented in KVMaterial. KVedaLoss is based on the
abstract interface provided by <a href="1.8.1/KVIonRangeTable.html">KVIonRangeTable</a>.
It
manages
a
list of KVedaLossMaterial objects which use the same
tabulation of ranges of heavy ions as before:<br>

The tabulated range of ions in each material as a function of incident
energy is implemented as a <a
 href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TF1.html">TF1</a> object. This
function is inverted using <a
 href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TF1.html#TF1:GetX">TF1::GetX</a>
in order to calculate residual energies or energy losses in finite
absorbers. This is the main difference from the previous
implementation, in which the original numerical inversion was used
(this had problems for certain cases, for example when calculating the
total energy loss of ions crossing <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>
identical absorbers of thickness <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>
and comparing with the calculated energy loss of the same ions in a
single absorber of thickness <span style="font-style: italic;">Nx</span>:
the
two
results
were not always the same, and could have a significant
difference).<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, all units and "thicknesses" have been rationalised
and standardised. Unless otherwise stated, all
linear dimensions are in centimetres, all masses are in grammes, and
all pressures are in torr. Units and "thickness" have the same meaning
for all materials. See <a href="1.8.1/KVUnits.html">KVUnits</a> for
converting from one unit to another.<br>
<br>
KVedaLoss is the default range table used by KVMaterial and KVDetector
classes to calculate energy losses of heavy ions. It can also be used
independently, as a "stand-alone" energy loss calculator:<br>
<pre>KVedaLoss* vedaloss = new KVedaLoss;<br>// calculate punch-through energy of 129Xe ions in 300um silicon detector<br>vedaloss-&gt;GetLinearPunchThroughEnergy("Si", 54, 129, 300*KVUnits::um);<br></pre>

<h2>Identification grid GUI</h2>
