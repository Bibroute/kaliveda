Between 0.03 and 0.02

Use an environment variable $GANILTAPE to point to the GANILTAPE directory
instead of an hardcoded value.

Build ganil2root (see below).

------------

Install in $HOME by default (instead of hardcoded value).


New functionnalities
--------------------

-> Scaler buffer can be automatically read and fill a dedicated TTree

The MakeTree capability is used by the new binary 'ganil2root' that can convert a ganil file/tape 
into ROOT format.
