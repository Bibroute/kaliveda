# Data Analysis #

Here are some guidelines for analysing data. Data can either be raw experimental
data, reconstructed experimental data (of
types `recon`, `ident` or `root`), or simulated data, either filtered with a
given experimental setup (in which case it is again reconstructed data) or not.

Two graphical interfaces are provided for analysing such data: [`KaliVedaGUI`][KaliVedaGUI] and
[`kaliveda-sim`][KaliVedaSim]. Both interfaces are capable of generating example analysis classes for the
data you want to analyse. This is the recommended method for creating a new analysis class, which you can
then modify according to your needs.

> N.B. In the case of experimental data, the exact inheritance required for your analysis class to work
> may depend on the dataset being analysed. This is handled automatically when generating a new class
> with [`KaliVedaGUI`][KaliVedaGUI]
