<h1>Global Variables for analysis of multibody events</h1>
END_HTML
A global variable is an analysis tool for condensing the information in a multibody event into one or a few
characteristic values. A simple example is the event multiplicity (the number of particles in each event),
which can be used to characterize heavy-ion collision events in terms of violence or centrality.

In KaliVeda, the base class for a multibody event is KVEvent, which is basically a collection of
nuclei (base class KVNucleus). Therefore the global variable classes below can be used with any
event described by a class derived from KVEvent, containing particles described by a class which
inherits from KVNucleus.

The list of classes below are base classes used for implementing global variables. KVVarGlob implements
the basic interface. KVVarGlob1 is a specialised base class for global variables which calculate a single
representative value. KVVarGlobMean is a further specialisation for variables which calculate the mean
value and variance of some quantity. KVVGSum is a very flexible class which can be easily configured to
calculate many user-defined global variables.
